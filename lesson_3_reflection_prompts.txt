When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I'd want to use a remote repository when:
    - I don't want to lose my work in a computer crash
    - I want to collaborate with others
    - I want to distribute my work across multiple environments

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I might want to pull changes manually in order to keep control of the code that is
    deployed to my local repository.  This helps with security and feature control.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks - copies of projects on GitHub that refer back to the original source
    Clones - copies of projects that exist as a new origin
    Branches - copies of projects within a project

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
